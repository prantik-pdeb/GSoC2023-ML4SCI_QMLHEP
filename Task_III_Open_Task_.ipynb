In this algorithm, quantum computing is first utilized to obtain Hamming distance in parallel then a sub-algorithm for searching the minimum of unordered integer sequence based on the two sub-algorithms. It shows that the algorithm can achieve a quadratic speedup by analyzing its time complexity. In this paper, the Quantum Support vector machine[4] can be implemented with an order of O(logN*M) in both training and classification. These algorithms are under supervised learning. \n",

In the hybrid quantum-classical ML model, classification with quantum neural network[7] here author proposed a QNN model designed with the near-term quantum processor in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this QNN on the near-term quantum computer where its power can be explored beyond what can be explored with simulation. In deep learning, image classification, segmentation, detection, and generation is an important task that has lots of application in the real world scenario. In this paper, the author discusses Quantum Convolutional Neural Network(QCNN) which uses only O(logN) variational parameter for input size N qubit, allowing its efficient training and implementation on near term quantum devices.
